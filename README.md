Tinkering with the ACE editor to support in-place mouseover.

1. Get a simple web-page with an embedded editor

2. Rig it so you can see where mouse is:

    * Some text box prints out the ID under the mouse

3. Get a tooltip working. See:

    https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/demo/kitchen-sink/token_tooltip.js#L34

   Just see the RAW hackery used for tooltips. DO NOT GET INTO THE REQUIRE.JS morass...
